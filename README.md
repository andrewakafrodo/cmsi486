# CMSI 486: Introduction to Database Systems

I took this course during the fall semester of 2013 under the instruction of Professor Ray Toal.

This was an independent study course and part of my requirement was that I make a weekly blog that can be found [here](https://github.com/frodosamoa/cmsi486/wiki/Weekly-Blog).
