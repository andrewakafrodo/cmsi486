We can see that there really is only one itemset with a size of 3: \{$milk, bread, eggs$\}. For our first rule, we can try rule $milk, eggs$ $\rightarrow$ $bread$. The confidence of this rule exceeeds the minumum confidence value of 0.7 since it is is $0.3/0.3$. For our second rule, let's try $bread$ $\rightarrow$ $milk, eggs$. The confidence of this rule satisfies the min confidence requirement since it is $0.3/0.4$.
